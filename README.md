# maps-old-spec-slots

Old maps for [Warzone 2100](https://github.com/Warzone2100/warzone2100) that use a now-deprecated hack to provide specific non-playable slots.

This was an old workaround used before Warzone 2100 added proper spectator support.

These maps are added here purely to preserve their history, and are _not_ listed in the map database.

> NOTE: The map files in this repo require Warzone 2100 >= 4.3
>
> To convert for use with earlier versions of WZ, use [maptools-cli](https://github.com/Warzone2100/maptools-cli).
